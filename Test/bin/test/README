1. There are 4 default variables.
	a. folderPath - This is Directory Path from where We have to write into files. It supports nested structure also.
	b. logFilePath - This is the file Path in which We have to log our results.
	c. initialDelayOfTask - This is time after which execution will be started.
	d. periodicDelayOfTask - This is interval for every write/read operation.
	
2. Used ScheduledExecutorService to maintain Scheduling for Tasks.
3. Created one method for Writing into Files.
4. Created one method for Reading from Files and Writing into Log file.
5. For File processing used common methods for read/write.
6. To only count word "CDS" used Pattern and mapped into Collection.
